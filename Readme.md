# LightDimmer

The LightDimmer is a versatile device designed to control the brightness of a single light fixture, supporting a load of up to 2A. This README provides a brief overview of the project's status and its available resources.

## Project Status

**Work In Progress (WIP)**

The LightDimmer project is currently a work in progress. As such, I am actively developing and refining its features, firmware, and hardware components. While the project is in its early stages, I recommend patience until a stable working prototype is achieved.

## Features

The LightDimmer aims to offer the following features once it reaches a stable state:

- **Dimmer Control**: Control the brightness of a single light fixture, allowing you to set the ambiance and lighting level in your space with ease.

- **Remote Control**: The LightDimmer can receive commands remotely, not only via Wi-Fi but also through ASK radio. This remote capability provides flexibility in how you manage your lighting, whether through a local network or other wireless means.

## Resources

To support the development and utilization of the LightDimmer, I provide the following resources:

- **Firmware**: The firmware for the LightDimmer is available as an ESPHome template YAML file. This file serves as a starting point for configuring and programming the device to enable dimmer control for your lighting unit.

- **Electronics**: The electronic design of the LightDimmer can be found in the KiCad project files. These files enable you to understand and customize the hardware aspects of the device to fit your specific needs.

## Getting Involved

I welcome contributors who are interested in helping me refine and complete the LightDimmer project. If you have ideas, suggestions, or code improvements, please feel free to contribute.
